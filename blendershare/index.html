                <h2>What is it?</h2>
                <p>
                    Blender is a software for creating and or animating 3d
                    models. These models can be used in video games, videos,
                    movies, or 3d printing. It offers a lot of functionality in
                    one piece of software, modeling, sculpting, texturing,
                    material creation, rigging, animating, physics simulations
                    (rigid body, cloth, fluid, etc), rendering, compositing, 2d
                    drawing, and it even can do some video editing. It is free
                    and open source, meaning free to get, plus, all the code
                    used to build it is free for anyone to look and make their
                    own changes.
                </p>

                <h2>Personal thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    Blender's community, from what I can tell is pretty great,
                    most will gladly help those starting to learn, or struggling
                    with issues. I started using it sometime in 2020 and more
                    actively in 2022. I certainly didn't learn it all at once (I
                    still haven't "learned it all"), but I have found it to be a
                    rewarding journey.
